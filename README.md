# SG20
The SG20 Token is based on a highly established ERC-20 technology, a technology that has 
taken over, thanks to the technical and programming features of the blockchain
of ETHEREUM.
In Ethereum, ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. These are technical documents that
define the programming standards on Ethereum. Once created, new ERC-20 tokens
are automatically interoperable with services and software that support the ERC-20 standard
software wallet, hardware wallet, exchange, etc.
ERC-20 technology over time has been increasingly aligned and refined, giving the ability to land on an increasingly cutting edge cryptographic key platform.
SG20, having been created as a token belonging to the Ethereum platform, can be used by all major wallets that support this technology, among the most famous are:
Metamask and Trust Wallet. 
They guarantee cryptographic keys with high standards, for this reason SGN chose Ethereum, security had to be guaranteed.
