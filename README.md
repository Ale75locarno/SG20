SECURITY AND ERC-20 TECHNOLOGY
The SG20 token is an innovative coin on the market because it combines the essence and advantages of a pure crypto,(ETHEREUM token based on ERC-20 technology, listed and exchangeable on the market) with the characteristics of an ASSET UTILITY.
 The owners of SG20 in fact participate with this token in the development of selected projects. Projects that are managed by institutional investors, thus creating an ecosystem suitable for security and guarantee for each user.
THE SG20 TOKEN AND ITS FUNCTIONING
The SG20 Token is based on a highly established ERC-20 technology, a technology that has 
taken over, thanks to the technical and programming features of the blockchain
of ETHEREUM.
In Ethereum, ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. These are technical documents that
define the programming standards on Ethereum. Once created, new ERC-20 tokens
are automatically interoperable with services and software that support the ERC-20 standard
software wallet, hardware wallet, exchange, etc.
ERC-20 technology over time has been increasingly aligned and refined, giving the ability to land on an increasingly cutting edge cryptographic key platform.
SG20, having been created as a token belonging to the Ethereum platform, can be used by all major wallets that support this technology, among the most famous are:
Metamask and Trust Wallet. 
They guarantee cryptographic keys with high standards, for this reason SGN chose Ethereum, security had to be guaranteed.
SG20 has also been tested on UNISWAP where the exchange and pairing was done through the USDT token with EXCELLENT test results.
