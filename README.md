# SG20
This project is the creation of a stablecoin that unifies the financial world with the crypto world. The project involves the creation of a hybrid token that contains two tokens, one equal to a Stable coin, which promotes the projects and assets present in the Luxembourgian source MAXIMUM partner of the Swiss Group Network company, the second will be associated with MINING. This association will allow to generate dividends for MAXIMUM and a prof off work for what concerns the token. An AIRDRP system will be associated and in the initial phase the users will become not only partners of the projects we are going to promote but also minority shareholders of the company for a maximum capitalization in the project itself of 22%. The project will provide various services to ecosystem users, but the biggest challenge is to automate SMARTCONTRACT so that ethereum users as a token already present on etherscan.io can freely and automatically purchase the token, paying with the classic banking formulas, cards, etc. or via cryptocurrency. The smart contract issues two tokens divided as follows.  60% will be a stablecoin 40% will be a pure cryptocurrency. the rewards will be generated automatically and monthly and will be based on prof off work and prof off stake, therefore the smartcontract will have to release their participations to all users. Furthermore, the dividends generated by MAXIMUM will be released annually
